## ðŸ†˜ Quick Troubleshooting

### Frontend can't connect to backend
```bash
# Check NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL in .env
# Should point to your backend URL
```

### Worker not processing jobs
```bash
# Check worker logs
docker-compose logs worker

# Restart worker
docker-compose restart worker
```

### Out of memory
```bash
# Increase EC2 instance size
# Or add swap:
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
